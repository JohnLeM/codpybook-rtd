Welcome to the Codpy, the book
===============================

This site is the companion site to the book *Reproducing Kernel Methods for Machine Learning, PDEs, and Statistics with Python*,
available on `arXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07084>`_ by Philippe G. LeFloch, Jean-Marc Mercier, and Shohruh Miryusupov.

The main purpose of this companion site is to provide facilities to reproduce all figures of the book, 
in order to ease the diffusion of RKHS methods to teachers, students and practitioners. It allows to

- facilitate the understanding of the material presented in the book, and to provide a hands-on introduction to CodPy, an open-source Python library for numerical algorithms, machine learning, and computational statistics.
- enable readers to experiment with the algorithms presented in the book, and to modify the code for their own purposes.
- offer a platform for sharing additional resources, such as datasets, code snippets, and tutorials related to the book's content.


About CodPy
-----------
CodPy (Curse Of Dimensionality in Python) is an open-source, RKHS dedicated, Python library designed for numerical algorithms, machine learning, and computational statistics. It has a wide range of applications in finance, engineering, and industry, 
and its technical documentation is located at this `url <https://codpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_.
