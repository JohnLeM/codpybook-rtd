Chapter 8: Reinforcement learning.
==================================

This gallery contains examples and tutorials for Chapter 8. The examples demonstrate how to use
the CodPy library to implement different Reinforcement Learning algorithms for two environments: Cartpole and LunarLander.

Each example includes code and outputs, such as plots or results, to help you understand
how the library works.

Below are the examples for this chapter:
