# Reproducing kernel methods for machine learning, PDEs, and statistics with CodPy

This repository accompanies the book  
**[Reproducing kernel methods for machine learning, PDEs, and statistics with Python](https://arxiv.org/)**  
by *Philippe G. LeFloch, Jean-Marc Mercier, and Shohruh Miryusupov* (available on arXiv).  

It provides **Python code implementations** and **reproductions of the experiments** detailed in the book using the [CodPy library](lien_a_ajouter).
