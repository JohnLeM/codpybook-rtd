# Reproducing kernel methods for machine learning, PDEs, and statistics with CodPy

This repository accompanies the book  
**[Reproducing kernel methods for machine learning, PDEs, and statistics with Python](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07084)**  
by *Philippe G. LeFloch, Jean-Marc Mercier, and Shohruh Miryusupov* (available on arXiv).  

It provides **Python code implementations** and allows to **reproduce all figures of the book**, which is based on the RKHS [CodPy library](https://pypi.org/project/codpy/).

## About CodPy

**CodPy (Curse Of Dimensionality in Python)** is an open-source Python library dedicated to RKHS for:

- Numerical algorithms  
- Machine learning  
- Computational statistics  

It has applications in **finance, engineering, and industry**.  

This repository focuses on **reproducing the experiments from the book** chapter by chapter.
